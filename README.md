IMPORTANT:

Make sure that your using Python 3.xx+
Make sure that you install the packages such as PySerial and Pandas etc, in the terminal of your IDE. If your IDE doesn't have a terminal, then try and go to enviornment settings and install the packages. The command for installing such packages are:

pip install pyserial
pip install pandas

Works only for Arduino Uno and Windows 10.
(Make sure you execute the Arduino code first and then the python code)
